SecretSentry - Advanced sensitive data scanner with Jupyter notebook support

SecretSentry is the first sensitive data scanner built specifically for modern
data science and web development workflows. It intelligently detects API keys,
PII, credentials, and other sensitive information while filtering out false
positives from Jupyter notebooks, HTML files, and other common sources.

Key Features:
- Jupyter notebook specialization with smart false positive filtering
- 50+ built-in detection patterns for various types of sensitive data
- Interactive analysis tools with pandas integration
- Context-aware sanitization with intelligent gibberish replacement
- Multi-environment support: CLI, Jupyter, and Python scripts
- Rich visualizations and reporting capabilities

Example usage:
    >>> from secretsentry import SecretSentry, quick_scan
    >>> scanner = quick_scan("./my_project")
    >>> findings = scanner.findings
    >>> scanner.display_findings()
